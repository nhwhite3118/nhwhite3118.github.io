<p>Shulker's Faithful Factories is a mod for <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/">Minecraft</a> 1.15 and 1.16 using the <a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Mods/Forge">Forge</a> API. It is meant to stay close to the experience of the vanilla game while adding new methods to farm for in game resources. Many engineers enjoy Minecraft because of its complex, Turing complete, form of wiring in-game contraptions called redstone. Shulker's Faithful Factories aims to add new mechanics so that items that could previously only be collected through exploration or semi-automatic farms which require the player to afk can be collected by making new types of redstone contraptions. Much of the mod's popularity can be attributed to the addition of Shulker Factories; procedurally generated structures containing a spawner for "Shulkers" which are hostile mobs that are non-renewable prior to Minecraft version 1.17.
