<p>Shulker's Faithful Factories is a mod for <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/">Minecraft</a> 1.15 and 1.16 using the <a href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Mods/Forge?oldid=1671940">Forge</a> API. It is meant to stay close to the experience of the vanilla game while adding new methods to farm for in game resources. Many engineers enjoy Minecraft because of its complex, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7284/what-is-turing-complete" target="_blank">Turing complete</a>, form of wiring in-game contraptions called <a href="https://education.minecraft.net/en-us/blog/learn-about-redstone" target="_blank">redstone</a>. Shulker's Faithful Factories aims to add new mechanics so that items that could previously only be collected through exploration, or semi-automatic farms which require the player to afk, can be collected by making new types of redstone contraptions. Much of the mod's popularity can be attributed to the addition of Shulker Factories. These factories are procedurally generated structures filled with traps and loot, and each contains a spawner for 'Shulkers': hostile mobs that are non-renewable prior to Minecraft version 1.17.

<p>Mods and data packs which add structures to Minecraft can be the difference between feeling like an explorer in an untouched jungle, or the sole survivor of a zombie apocalypse. Shulker's Super Simple Structure System is meant to provide a way for players and modpack designers with no coding experience to have the structures they have made generate automatically in their worlds and/or their friend's worlds. It is especially useful for modpack designers who wish to create a certain atmosphere in their modpack by spawning structures of their design in the biome(s) of their choice, with a rarity of their choosing.

<p>Shulker's Structures predates Shulker's Super Simple Structure System, and was the main source of inspiration for the structure system. After creating Shulker's Faithful Factories, I realized that I had many structures in my single player minecraft world that could easily made into structure files, and which would bring some life to the average Minecraft world. While it could be mostly remade inside of Shulkers Simple Structure System, I left the mod up to serve as an easy way for modpack designers to add structures, and because some of the structures in this mod have unusual spawning mechanics which could not be easily replicated. For instance, it adds barns which can only spawn near, but not within, villages.

<p>
	The Autonomous Cars track of the Freshman Research Initiative (FRI) at UT Austin allowed freshmen to write code that would potentially be ran on UT's own autonomous car. I was part of the final class before the track changed to Autonomous Robots due to a decreasing number of successful student projects as the available tasks had become more difficult each year until it was too difficult for most freshmen. The fall semester that year had around 20-30 students, and only 3 of us remained in the spring semester, where the focus changed to reviewing and presenting summaries of research papers detailing important robotics navigation algorithms, such as Monte Carlo Localization, and various computer vision algorithms. The next year I went on to be an Undergraduate Mentor for the newly created Autonomous Robots track, which replaced the Autonomous Car track.

<p>
	As an Undergraduate Mentor, I held office hours and assisted any groups which needed help with their projects. The robot used became a segue with a marine battery, laptop, and kinect camera attached; much simpler and safer for freshmen to work with than the car of previous years. Due to the slight change in subject matter, and working with a different grad student this year, I attended the classes in order to be the best mentor possible, and learned much more than I expected. The students this year were much more successful with their projects than those in the car track the year prior, with projects varying from calibrating a drone made from scratch by Electrical Engineering students, to controlling the drone using an electroencephalogram measuring brain activity, to controlling the segue robots using kinect gestures, to autonomously mapping our floor of the building (elevators were a bit much for the first year, no matter how much we wanted the robots to be able to fetch coffee).

<h4>  <a href="https://aztecworld.espwebsite.com/">Aztec Promotional Group</a> </h4>
<p>
	Aztec is a screen-printing company headquartered in Austin, TX. During my time at Aztec, I maintained legacy internal software used for Customer Relations Management (CRM), production management, and artwork tracking. Once we were comfortable with the stability of the legacy apps, I also began the process of migrating the legacy programs to the cloud, completely migrating the server and production management software to a web-based model, along with sections of the CRM software. We shared an office with a sister company, Axial Commerce, and some of my favorite memories from my time at Aztec were conferring with the Axial developers about design choices, the occasional odd remark about idiosyncrasies between programming languages, and getting to see the tech needs of two companies along with how well each attempted solution worked.
</p>

<h4>  <a href="https://alphamodus.com/">EyeQ</a> </h4>
<p>		
	My first tech-related internship was with EyeQ, a start up of only four people at the time, which has since been acquired by Alpha Modus. EyeQ's core technology was image recognition software that could track various demographics information, with the intended use being to provide insights to retailers about shopping habits. It could track return visitors to a business, estimate age with surprising accuracy, and track the moods of customers based on their expressions. During my internship, I researched various ways to improve the accuracy of the age-detection software, which was being thrown off slightly by the presence of glasses, and return customer tracking, around the time iOS began randomizing MAC addresses in an attempt to prevent device tracking.
<br><br>
	Despite being a small company, our CTO had close to a decade of experience working at Dell, and was able to introduce me to some of the processes and strategies used by larger companies when it comes to QA testing and planning feature development. The daily scrum was especially interesting at EyeQ due to the small size of the company. While it may not have been strictly necessary for me to know how things were going on the CEO's side of the company, it provided a sense of meaning to the work, and excitement about future contracts, to an extent which I have not seen since my time there.
