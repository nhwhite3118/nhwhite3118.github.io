<p>Shulker's Faithful Factories is a mod for <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/">Minecraft</a> 1.15 and 1.16 using the <a href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Mods/Forge?oldid=1671940">Forge</a> API. It is meant to stay close to the experience of the vanilla game while adding new methods to farm for in game resources. Many engineers enjoy Minecraft because of its complex, Turing complete, form of wiring in-game contraptions called redstone. Shulker's Faithful Factories aims to add new mechanics so that items that could previously only be collected through exploration or semi-automatic farms which require the player to afk can be collected by making new types of redstone contraptions. Much of the mod's popularity can be attributed to the addition of Shulker Factories; procedurally generated structures containing a spawner for "Shulkers" which are hostile mobs that are non-renewable prior to Minecraft version 1.17.

<p>Mods and data packs which add structures to Minecraft can be the difference between feeling like an explorer in an untouched jungle, or the sole survivor of a zombie apocalypse. Shulker's Super Simple Structure System is meant to provide a way for players and modpack designers with no coding experience to have the structures they have made generate automatically in their worlds and/or their friends worlds. It is especially useful for modpack designers who wish to create a certain atmosphere in their modpack by spawning structures of their design in the biome(s) of their choice, with a rarity of their choosing.

<p>Shulker's Structures predates Shulker's Super Simple Structure System, and was the main source of inspiration for the structure system. After creating Shulker's Faithful Factories, I realized that I had many structures in my single player minecraft world that could easily made into structure files, and which would bring some life to the average Minecraft world. While it could be mostly remade inside of Shulkers Simple Structure System, I left the mod up to serve as an easy way for modpack designers to add structures, and because some of the structures in this mod have unusual spawning mechanics which could not be easily replicated. For instance, it adds barns which can only spawn near, but not within, villages.
